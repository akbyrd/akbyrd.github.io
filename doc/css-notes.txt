Reset
-----
Should I use a reset or not?

Reset
* Have to re-implement a lot of boilerplate
* Might have mistakes from missing boilerplate
	* More likely to come up in comments where I can't predict / preview the content
	* Not always possible/reasonable to re-implement (browser specific attributes, newer CSS features)

No Reset
* Site may look different on different browsers
* Will have to fight the browser styles in some cases

Issues
* img loses its size if the file isn't found when using all: unset
* MathML styles are relatively complex (and use new CSS features)



Guidelines
----------
HTML is semantic, CSS is visual
	Do not embed visual information into HTML
	Use semantic classes only
Vaguely follow BEM for CSS classes
Target HTML tags before classes
	HTML tags
	HTML single classes
	HTML multiple classes



Methodologies
-------------
BEM (Block-Element-Modifier)
SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS)
Atomic/Utility-First CSS
