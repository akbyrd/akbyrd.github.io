Browsers are awful.



Mobile, Android - All
---------------------

Most browsers seem to have problems with mouse events on the left side of the screen. Possibly due
to that space being used for swipe gestures? Potentially fixed on newer versions of Android.
* Occurs on Pixel 5 with Android 14.
* Doesn't occur on LG G7 ThinQ with Android 9.
* Occurs on Firefox, Chrome, DuckDuckGo
* Does not ooccur on Opera



Mobile, Android - Firefox
---------------------

Stops sending mouse, touch, or pointer events if the scroll wheel is used or a touch occurs while a
mouse button is held. This workaround mostly recovers, but we can still get stuck in line selection
mode until the mouse is moved.



Desktop, Windows - Firefox, Chrome
----------------------------------

Middle click isn't captured by the window. Entering scroll mode them moving off the window will get
stuck using the last scroll speed.

Mouse up is not sent if mouse button is released while in scroll mode (middle click) and not over
the window.
