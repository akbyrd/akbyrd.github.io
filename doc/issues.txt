Browsers are awful.

Most Android browsers seem to have problems with mouse events on the left side of the screen.
Possibly due to that space being used for swipe gestures? Potentially fixed on newer versions of
Android.
* Occurs on Pixel 5 with Android 14.
* Doesn't occur on LG G7 ThinQ with Android 9.
* Occurs on Firefox, Chrome, DuckDuckGo
* Does not ooccur on Opera

Firefox on Android stops sending mouse, touch, or pointer events if the scroll wheel is used or a
touch occurs while a mouse button is held. This workaround mostly recovers, but we can still get
stuck in line selection mode until the mouse is moved.
