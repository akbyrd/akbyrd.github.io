Approaches
----------
1 - giscus
	site: 50.90 kB
	giscus: 124.96 kB
	Might pull in MathJax and other dependencies

2 - giscus self hosted
	requires a server (e.g. https://vercel.com/)
	requires learning how it works

3 - Read only comments, link to discussions page
	Query requires authentication

4 - Link to discussions page
	Can't see on page



To Do
-----
Choose: button only (none), read only (device flow), interactive (giscus)
Test the device flow. Is it one time only?
Investigate a custom server for OAuth
