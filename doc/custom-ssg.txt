Ideas & Requirements
--------------------
* Similar style to Hugo: content files and templates than render those content files
* Use Ninja to run the build graph
* Allow command line tools to be used for any part of the rendering process
* Use libclang to do proper syntax highlighting
* Web server for iterating
* Incremental builds with web server
* Render HTML properly indented for readability (still minify for production)
* Hot reload for the generator itself
* Compiles to WASM and runs in browser
	* Dependencies must compile to WASM as well



Motivation
----------
* Real syntax highlighting
* Offline rendering of LaTeX to SVG/HTML/MathML
* HTML classes for any element (namely, inline ones)
* HTML formatting for readability
* Simplicity
* Render dynamic content like math in comments (WASM)
* Render different graph types
* Tooltips for :emoji:
