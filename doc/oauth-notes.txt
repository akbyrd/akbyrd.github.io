Github supports auth through Github Apps and OAuth
https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql#authenticating-with-graphql
	App - OAuth 2.0. User or Self. Fine-grained permissions.
	OAuth - OAuth 2.0. User only.

Probably use an App. Should only need permission for my repository.

Notes
-----
Repository owners must install the app to allow it to read and write Discussions in that repo.
Users must authorize the app to post Discussion comments on their behalf.
Thus, the app _only_ has access to Discussions.
But I think a user authorizing the bot on one blog will apply to all blogs that use it.



Plan
----
Use an App (can limit to a single repo, can limit to issues but not code)
Attempt to use device flow for auth
Self auth for creating discussions
User auth for querying discussions if not signed in
User auth for querying discussions if signed in (for reaction attribution)
User auth for making posts
Install app to account / repository (needed so it can create dicussions)
TODO: If a user authorizes for a single repo, how does the app detect this and request permissions on a second repo?



Hosting
-------
Languages: native, WASM, TS

AWS Lambda         - Native, Node, Py, Ruby, Java, Go, .NET Core
Microsoft Azure    - TS, JS, C#, F#, Py, pwsh, Java
Google Cloud       - Node, Go, .NET Core, Py, Java, Ruby, PHP
Cloudflare Workers - TS, JS, WASM, Py. Sounds fast
Netlify            - TS, JS, Go. Maybe easier to automate? AWS.
Vercel             - Node, Go, Py, Ruby, Deno, Rust. Maybe easier to automate? Sounds fast. AWS.
Digital Ocean      - Node, Go, Py, PHP. CLI.

Requirements
Language: TS and {native, WASM, or Go}
Custom domain



Digital Ocean
-------------
Buggy
BUG: Deploying sometimes hangs
BUG: Building locally then remotely causes tsc not be flagged an executable
BUG: doctl prints incremental progress only once the process is complete
Error messages aren't great
Web requests don't generate activation records or logging (can use web interface or REST API and POST when testing)
NO way to get notifications for errors (unless moving to the App Platform)
Event object is empty when using REST API or browser tests
Deploying blows up environment variables
Doesn't have a way to run entirely locally
Can't use paths/endpoints when testing in the web UI

doctl serverless watch api
doctl serverless deploy api --remote-build
doctl serverless functions invoke api -p param:value
doctl serverless activations logs --follow
