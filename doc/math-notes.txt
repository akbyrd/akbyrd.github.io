NOTE: Behavior is different between browsers and sometimes buggy. Styling issues are extremely subtle.
Common  - MathML equations don't wrap https://jsfiddle.net/h079jkqo/89/
Firefox - Doesn't use or support `display: inline math` or `block math`
Firefox - Doesn't wrap annotations unless math is disabled in settings
Firefox - block math defaults to `text-align: center`
Firefox - block math handles `min-width: fit-content` as if all content is on a single line
Firefox - Doesn't support `overflow-wrap: anywhere;` (entire equation will still wrap)
Firefox - Doesn't support `position: absolute;` on <mtd> (e.g. line numbers)
Firefox - Doesn't support `display: math;` which makes support detection impossible
Chrome  - `display: inline` on annotation is replaced with `block` if semantics is `block`
Chrome  - Padding on inline annotation is wrong size if set to `block`
Chrome  - inline math treated as block unless forced to `inline`
Chrome  - Doesn't support columnalign (or just about any attributes)
