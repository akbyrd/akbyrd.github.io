Reduce Contrast
---------------
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
	img { filter: brightness(.8) contrast(1.2); }
}



Transitions
-----------
Parent transitions reset child transitions in chromium based browsers. This causes transitions to execute in sequence rather than parallel and looks bad. Theme transitions should be implemented with html { transition-duration: inherit; } but this triggers the bug. Putting transition-duration on the body is an acceptable workaround. Most of the affected colors are inherited, which means the colors are transitioned once then inherited, instead of being re-transitioned at each level of the html hierarchy. transition-duration: 200ms can be sprinkled in select location where the lack of inherited transition is noticeable.

Code

Clickable Line Numbers
https://jsfiddle.net/oj3h7pwu/28/ - ::before and counter, requires each line to be separate <code>
https://codepen.io/phuocng/pen/gOqVWQX - textarea. Confines selection to code, but doesn't stretch and can't select entire page
Pointer events are new-ish (2019)
Touch events are supported as of 2017
Don't use pointer events
- No sense in limiting mouse support
- Can't clear touch-action and still have to use touch events to block scrolling
- Would be a lot simpler though
Pointer events come before touch events
Synthesized mouse events come at the end of the touch interaction
Synthesized mouse events only for single taps (not after dragging or multiple touches)
PointerEvent.pointerId and Touch.identifier are the same
