Reduce Contrast
---------------
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
	img { filter: brightness(.8) contrast(1.2); }
}



Transitions
-----------
Parent transitions reset child transitions in chromium based browsers. This causes transitions to execute in sequence rather than parallel and looks bad. Theme transitions should be implemented with html { transition-duration: inherit; } but this triggers the bug. Putting transition-duration on the body is an acceptable workaround. Most of the affected colors are inherited, which means the colors are transitioned once then inherited, instead of being re-transitioned at each level of the html hierarchy. transition-duration: 200ms can be sprinkled in select location where the lack of inherited transition is noticeable.
